1. Declare a few variables. Try assigning different types of
values to these variables, and observe the compiler
errors. Increment integer variables. Pass and mutate
these variables in a function, and check whether your
changes are visible outside the function.
2. Declare pointers to the variables, and pass them to
functions. Mutate the variables through these pointers,
and observe your changes from the caller.
